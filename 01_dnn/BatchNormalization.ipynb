    "\n",
    "As standard scaling improves learning by normalizing each feature in the training dataset, batch normalization normalizes input to every unit of a hidden layer within a batch. Estimated distribution is over the samples in the batch.\n",
    "Typically, batch normalization is done before the activation function, but this is not a hard rule.\n",

    "Parameters $\\tilde{\\textbf{v}}^{[l]}$ and $\\tilde{\\textbf{u}}^{[l]}$ are learnable with back propagation.\n",
    "Batch normalization of layer $l$ pre-activation makes the input to the layer $l+1$ vary less, since the between-iterations, same-unit distribution's mean and variance are fixed. This improves the speed of learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since estimates of mean and variance are different for each batch, $\\textbf{z}^{[l]}$ gets noisy, which also acts as small regularizer. The quantity of noise reduces with the size of the batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "For validation time, estimate $\\textbf{v}^{[l]}$ and $\\textbf{u}^{[l]}$ as exponentially weighted average across the training mini-batches. Use these estimates instead of the validation dataset's properties.\n",
