    "In the class demo we have seen an example where we hold the truncation factor and the noise constant, while smoothly changing the class vector from one class to another. In this assignment, let's explore what will happen if we change the truncation factor and the noise, while holding the class vector constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment consists of the following tasks required to achieve the goal described above:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate 10 different truncation factors in the interval (0, 1].\n",
    "2. For each truncation factor, generate 5 different noise vectors using that truncation factor.\n",
    "3. Create one-hot-encoded vector for the class label \"mushroom\". \n",
    "4. Given all the inputs, generate and plot 50 different images of mushrooms.\n",
    "5. Make a conclusion about relationship between the truncation factor and the model output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this assignment is 20 points, each task is 4 points. Throughout this assignment, you may copy/call any code from the class material, including Jupyter notebooks and utils.py file.\n",

    "\n",
    "You need to generate an array of noise vectors. However, now is also a good time to talk about the batch size. Recall that the truncation factor is used to generate the noise, but it's also an input to the model itself. Even though, the goal is to generate 50 images, the model is using the same truncation factor for all images generated in a single batch. This means that to generate images for 10 different truncation factors, you will need to evaluate the model with 10 separate batches. In summary, you need 10 batches with 5 noise vectors in each batch. \n",
    "\n",
    "You need to use a different random seed to generate the noise vectors for every batch. Otherwise, the noise vectors will be similar between batches, and you won't see enough diversity in the images to make conclusions. Also, use the truncation threshold of 5 to get some low-probability noise vectors into the batch.\n",
